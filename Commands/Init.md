# git init

The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository

If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do the following commands:

```
mkdir New Directory
cd NewDirectory
git init 
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./commit),
[push](./push)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the currect dirrectory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
